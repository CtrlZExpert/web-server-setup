# RHEL 9 Web Server Project

This project shows how to set up Apache and Nginx web servers on RHEL 9. The goal is to practice Linux skills and learn how to run web servers manually.

## Why I Did This Project

I made this project to show that I can set up web servers from scratch. Doing this helped me understand services, firewall rules, and how to make websites on Linux.

## Apache Setup
- Install Apache, start it, and allow HTTP/HTTPS through the firewall.
- Test the default page.
- Create a custom virtual host for a sample website.

## Nginx Setup
- Install Nginx and set it to port 8080 so it does not conflict with Apache.
- Create a test website.
- Start Nginx and allow traffic if needed.

## Skills Learned
- Installing and running Apache and Nginx
- Managing services with systemd
- Configuring firewall rules
- Setting up virtual hosts and server blocks
- Troubleshooting issues and reading logs
